# Incentive and Regulation 
Final reports for the course Incentives & Regulation ([M2 EMO](https://www.tse-fr.eu/master-emo-international-track)) at [Toulouse School of Economics (TSE)](https://tse-fr.eu/). 

The PDFs in the `submission` folder were created with [Weave.jl](https://github.com/JunoLab/Weave.jl), a Julia package for to writing reproducible documents in Julia Markdown. 

To `weave` the PDFs for the respective projects, simply run the following in a [Julia REPL](https://docs.julialang.org/):

```julia
using Weave
weave("filename.jmd")
```
